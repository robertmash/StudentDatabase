# Student Database Prooject
- Cleaned, standardised and normalised a student test score database. 
- This database in then stored and loaded into SQL 
- I then export this database, creating specific classifications for hardworking, overall performance and underperforming students
- Finally, I use Tkinter to create a GUI so the user can input a students ID, and itll display their overall performance. 
- This also displays all underperforming and overperforming students.
